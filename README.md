###Project Title: Smart Home Automation System


####Objective:
       To create a basic home automation system that allows users to control various household devices (like lights and fans) remotely using a microcontroller, sensors, and actuators.

####Components:
*Microcontroller*: Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
*Sensors*:Motion Sensor (PIR),Light Sensor (LDR)
*Actuators*:Relay module (to control high-voltage devices),LED lights (for testing),Fan (optional)
*Power Supply*: USB or battery for Arduino
*Connectivity*: Optional Wi-Fi module (like ESP8266) for remote access
*Features*:Motion Detection: Automatically turn on lights when motion is detected.
*Light Control*: Adjust lighting based on ambient light levels (using LDR).
*Remote Control*: Control devices via a mobile app or web interface (if using Wi-Fi module).
*Scheduling*: Set timers for devices to turn on/off at specific times.
*Workflow*:
   Circuit Design: Use Tinkercad to create a circuit diagram, connecting sensors and actuators to the Arduino.
   Programming: Write code to handle sensor input and control outputs. Utilize libraries as needed (e.g., for Wi-Fi connectivity).
   Simulation: Test the circuit and code in Tinkercadâ€™s simulation environment to ensure everything works as intended.
   Documentation: Prepare a detailed report outlining the project objectives, components, circuit schematics, code snippets, and testing results.


####Expected Outcomes:
     A functional prototype of a smart home automation system.
     An understanding of how to integrate sensors and actuators with a microcontroller.
     Basic experience in programming for automation tasks.
 

####Conclusion:
                This project provides a hands-on introduction to home automation, allowing learners to explore the integration of hardware and software in a practical context. Adjustments and expansions can be made based on interest, such as adding more sensors or integrating more complex control systems.
